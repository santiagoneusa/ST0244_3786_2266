# Programming Languajes
This was a course I took in 2022-2 where I learned so much about programming paragims and the various types of languajes we have.
The firts part was an introduccion to assemblers and how they were helpful to make a path between people and computers. Then we learned how imperative languajes works, in this case using C++ (Project 1), and almost at the end we use functional programming in Scala to develop a program to solve prefix notation (Project 2).

## Project 1
Aquí yace la práctica 1 de lenguajes de programación. 
El archivo 'main.cpp' es el que se debe correr, el header 'methods.h' contiene los métodos del programa, así que si se ejecuta, posiblemente genere error.

## Project 2
This project is in Scala, the main file has all you need to run it and has a default test in the main object.
