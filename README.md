# Programming Languages
This was a course I took in 2022-2 where I learned so much about programming paragims and the various types of languajes we have.
The firts part was an introduccion to assemblers and how they were helpful to make a path between people and computers. Then we learned how imperative languajes works, in this case using C++ (Project 1), and almost at the end we use functional programming in Scala to develop a program to solve prefix notation (Project 2).

## Project 1
The idea of this project was learning OOP and Data Structures (linked lists).
This project is in C++, 'main.cpp' is the file that contain the interface but 'methods.h' is the header where the methods are. Download both but just compile and run the main.
## Project 2
The idea of this project was learning Functional Programing and use a new Data Structure (trees), but also accompanied with OOP.
This project is in Scala, the main file has all you need to run it and has a default test in the main object.
